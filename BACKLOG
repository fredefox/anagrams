Evaluate anagrams concurrently

Partial anagrams
----
Add option to find partial anagrams. So for instance `sea` has the
following anagrams:

    a,ae,as,e,ea,es,s,sa,se,sea

Order of dictionary
----
There seems to be a bug in `buildForest`. The order of the elements in
the dictionary are significant:

    > buildForest ["a", "ab"]
    [Node {rootLabel = ('a',True),  subForest = [Node {rootLabel = ('b',True), subForest = []}]}]
    > buildForest ["ab", "a"]
    [Node {rootLabel = ('a',False), subForest = [Node {rootLabel = ('b',True), subForest = []}]}]

Modularize partial sub-matches
----
Make `anagramsT` more modular so that we can add an option to include
partial anagrams.
